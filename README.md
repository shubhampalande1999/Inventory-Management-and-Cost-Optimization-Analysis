Overview:
This repository presents a detailed analysis of inventory management and cost optimization for businesses. The focus is on reducing overall inventory costs by making informed decisions on ordering and holding inventory. The analysis covers various aspects such as decision variables, economic order quantity, reorder point, sensitivity analysis, and simulation using different probability distributions.

Contents:

Part 1:

Introduction to Inventory Management:
Explanation of the importance of managing inventory for cost reduction.
Differentiation between holding costs and ordering costs.

Analysis of Decision Variables:
Decision variables include order quantity, inventory per order, and number of orders.
Utilization of R and Excel Solver for calculations.
Comparison of results obtained from mathematical functions and data tables.

Line Plots and Sensitivity Analysis:
Line plots to visualize the relationship between total cost and order quantity.
Utilization of Excel Solver for sensitivity analysis on carrying cost rate and order cost.

Part 2:

Optimization Using Triangular Probability Distribution:
Analysis of annual demand with a triangular probability distribution.
Simulation of 5000 occurrences to determine minimum total cost, order quantities, and annual number of orders.

Goodness-of-Fit Test with Lognormal Distribution:
Assessment of the lognormal distribution as a fit for the data.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to validate the distribution.
Calculation of AIC and BIC values for the distribution.

Conclusion:
The conclusion emphasizes the use of decision variables and various optimization techniques to enhance inventory management, reduce costs, and maintain financial stability for businesses.
